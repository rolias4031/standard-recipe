### About
Standard Recipe makes creating, sharing, and viewing recipes a breeze. It offers an intuitive creation flow, dedicated pages to view recipes, and a smart viewer that embeds information into your recipes, such as quick conversions, notes, and substitutions.

### Features
1. Standard Recipe makes recipe easy to create using our intuitive creation flow
2. Standard Recipe makes recipes easy to share by giving each of your recipes a dedicated link
3. Standard Recipe makes recipes easy to use through our smart features that put valuable information about the recipe right at your fingertips, like important notes, substitutions, quantities, and instant conversions. Focus on cooking, not scrolling up and down with flour-covereed fingers because you forget how many teaspoons of extract to add.
4. The App also features the quickest and most accurate recipe import feature on the web using OpenAI. Simply copy and paste your recipe, and Standard Recipe will break it down into ingredients, equipment, and instructions and give it all the benefits we offer.

### Future

Eventually, I'd love to make Standard Recipe the GitHub for recipes, where people apply all the basics of git, but also have a dedicated platform with great features for creating, sharing, and viewing. As of right now, such an app doesn't exist.
